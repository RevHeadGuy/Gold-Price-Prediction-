📌 Introduction
Gold is a crucial financial asset, and predicting its price can help investors and analysts make informed decisions. This project aims to develop a predictive model using historical data and machine learning techniques.

🏗️ Project Overview
The project follows these key steps:

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values
Feature selection
Normalization & scaling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing trends in gold prices
Analyzing correlations with other economic indicators
Feature Engineering

Creating meaningful features to improve model accuracy
Model Training & Evaluation

Implementing machine learning models
Tuning hyperparameters for better performance
📊 Dataset
The dataset contains historical gold price data along with influencing economic factors such as stock market indices, crude oil prices, and currency exchange rates.

Key Features:

Date
Gold Price
Market Indicators (e.g., S&P 500, USD Index)
Other Commodities (e.g., Crude Oil)

⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/RevHeadGuy/Gold-Price-Prediction.git
cd Gold-Price-Prediction

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Gold_Price_Prediction.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate their performance.

🤖 Models Implemented
The project experiments with multiple machine learning models, including:

Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
LSTM Neural Networks (if applicable)
📏 Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using standard regression metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (R²) Score

📈 Results
The best-performing model is identified based on its predictive accuracy and generalization ability. Visualizations such as predicted vs. actual price trends are included in the notebook.
